# BalanceBot - A Self Balancing Robot
## When controlling a self-balancing robot, it is simplest to treat it as an inverted pendulum on a moving cart
### Where:
### pendulum has length l and mass m
### cart has mass M

### For our robot, M is approximately mass of the wheels + mass of the motors
### l is the length from center of mass of the frame, and m is approximately the mass of the frame with all electrical components
